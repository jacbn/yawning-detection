# Testing

## Unit tests

This directory contains the unit tests for the program. The structure of this directory mirrors that of the main code for simplicity.

Tests are written using the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module. To run them, execute the following from the project root:

`python -m unittest discover ./yawnn/test/`
