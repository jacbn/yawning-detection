# yawning-detection

A third-year project to detect yawns using the IMU inside a pair of [eSense in-ear headphones](https://esense.io/).

## Structure

/yeimu/ is the mobile data collection app for communicating with and collecting data from the headphones, then sending it elsewhere for further analysis.
